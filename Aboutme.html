    <h1>About Me</h1>
</head>
<body>
<p>I'm a hospitality leader, sommelier, and technologist-in-training based in San Francisco. </p>
<p> My career began in world-class dining rooms—from Napa Valley to the Bay Area—where I worked as a 
    sommelier, wine director, and manager at Michelin-starred restaurants. Today, I'm the General Manager
     at Frances, where I focus on building thoughtful guest experiences, developing strong teams, and running a
      modern, people-first operation.</p>

<p>Outside of the restaurant world, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science, expanding my skills in C++, data
 structures, and applied machine learning. I'm passionate about the intersection of hospitality, technology, and 
 leadership —particularly how systems, tools, and people can work together to create seamless experiences. Increase margins, 
 reduce overhead, and bring about a healthier industry</p>

<p>When I'm not studying or working service, you'll usually find me climbing at Mission Cliffs, exploring
 San Francisco's food scene, or spending time with my cat, Ellie.
